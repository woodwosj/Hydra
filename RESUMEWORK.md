# RESUMEWORK.md â€“ Multi-Agent Orchestration Layer

## PROJECT STATUS SNAPSHOT
### Last Updated: 2025-09-23T19:49:56Z
### Session ID: hydra-session-20250923T194956Z
### Active Branch: main
### Workflow Stage: IMPLEMENTING

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Hydra MCP is in the implementation phase of its orchestration layer, focusing on end-to-end task, session, and worktree tracking. Core Codex integration and persistence features are in place, and we are now extending continuity across restarts. The critical path centers on persisting resumable state and tightening status surfaces; no blocking risks identified beyond upcoming data migration decisions.

## AGENT ACTIVATION CONTEXT

### For Next Agent Activation
**ACTIVATE**: CODER_IMPLEMENTATION (after Conport Manager compiles persistence context)
**REASON**: Need implementation of resumable task state ingestion prior to reviewer pass.

### Critical Context for Resumption
1. **Architecture Decisions**
   - MCP server uses FastMCP tool decorators; modular components registered at bootstrap.
   - ChromaDB is authoritative store for events, tasks, and context packages.
   - Task orchestration currently in-memory; persistence upgrade underway.

2. **Technical Constraints**
   - Preserve backward compatibility with existing tool schemas.
   - Status resource must respond in <150ms to avoid host timeouts.
   - Avoid blocking operations in MCP tool handlers (async required).

3. **Known Issues/Gotchas**
   - Task state lost on restart (current priority fix).
   - Worktree paths currently provided via context; enforce validation.
   - FastMCP dependency not available in test environment; rely on stubs.

4. **Testing Requirements**
   - Maintain `PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/pytest` green.
   - Add regression tests for task state replay.
   - Validate JSON serialization of status output.

5. **External Dependencies**
   - chromadb (embedded) for persistence.
   - Codex CLI (path configurable) for agent spawning.
   - (Future) Conport API for context storage.

### Environment Setup Requirements
```bash
node: 18.17.0
python: 3.11
postgresql: 15
redis: 7.0

# Environment variables
CODEX_PATH=
CODEX_DEFAULT_MODEL=
CHROMA_PERSIST_PATH=./storage/chroma
HYDRA_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### Recent Decisions & Rationale
- Store task/session/worktree events in Chroma to support replayable orchestration.
- Surface status previews instead of full timelines for lightweight monitoring.
- Retain in-memory task map for fast access; plan to hydrate from Chroma on startup.

## WORKFLOW STATE MACHINE

### Current State: IMPLEMENTING
### Valid Transitions:
- PLANNING â†’ IMPLEMENTING
- IMPLEMENTING â†’ REVIEWING
- REVIEWING â†’ IMPLEMENTING (if rejected)
- REVIEWING â†’ DEPLOYED (if approved)
- DEPLOYED â†’ PLANNING (next iteration)

### State History (Last 5)
1. IMPLEMENTING (HYD-008)
2. IMPLEMENTING (HYD-007)
3. IMPLEMENTING (HYD-006)
4. IMPLEMENTING (HYD-005)
5. IMPLEMENTING (HYD-004)

### Metrics
- Average Review Cycles: TBD (initial reviewer handoff pending)
- Average Task Completion: 4.0 hours (est.)
- Context Reuse Rate: 70% (via shared context packages)
- Parallel Execution Frequency: 30% (two active tracks planned)

## ORCHESTRATION OPTIMIZATION RULES

### Parallel Execution Triggers
- When updating RESUMEWORK.md, concurrently update Conport, analyze parallelizable tasks (HYD-010/HYD-012), prep next agent context, archive task artifacts.

### Context Preservation Strategy
- Persist error/debug patterns, performance benchmarks (Chroma event templates), security guidelines (tool descriptions), architecture rationale (docs/multiagent_workflow.md), and validated testing strategies.

### Handoff Optimization
- Each handoff must specify next action, context references (Chroma session timestamps), success criteria (task acceptance), blockers (dependency graph), and rollback (replay event stream).

### Continuous Improvement
- After each task completion: log actuals to Chroma, document new patterns, append to error knowledge base, refine agent prompts in `profiles/` as needed.

## Usage Instructions

1. Load this orchestration prompt when modifying RESUMEWORK.md.
2. Execute sections in parallel, cross-reference Conport packages, validate state transitions, and prepare next agent activation instructions.
3. To resume work, start with *Project Status Snapshot*, load appropriate agent profile, fetch context package (CPK-2025-009), assess parallel opportunities, proceed with implementation.

### Critical Success Metrics
- Zero context gaps between handoffs
- 100% decision traceability via Chroma + RESUMEWORK.md
- Parallel execution whenever dependency graph allows
- Growing knowledge base in Conport (CTX-* packages)
- Decreasing review cycles once reviewer agent activates

**Single Source of Truth**: RESUMEWORK.md captures the live brain of Hydra MCP. Keep it synchronized with Conport to enable any agent to resume seamlessly.
