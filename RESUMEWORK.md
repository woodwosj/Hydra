# RESUMEWORK.md â€“ Multi-Agent Orchestration Layer

## PROJECT STATUS SNAPSHOT
### Last Updated: 2025-09-24T09:02:57Z
### Session ID: hydra-session-20250924T090257Z
### Active Branch: main
### Workflow Stage: IMPLEMENTING

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Hydra MCP now supports injected Codex runners, startup resume of running tasks, and metrics-focused diagnostics. Tool handles now keep live snapshots of sessions/worktrees, restart attempts accrue consecutive failure counts, and threshold breaches emit warnings plus `resume_alert` events persisted to Chroma and surfaced via status/CLI metrics (`hydra_diag alerts`). Status payload exposes `resume_metrics.active_alert_count` / `most_recent_alert`, giving operators real-time visibility. Critical path shifts to validating end-to-end auto-resume flows and wiring alerts into downstream monitoring/notification; no active blockers identified.

## COMPREHENSIVE TODO CHECKLIST

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL PATH (Blocks other work)
- [ ] HYD-019: Auto-resume execution hooks & monitoring
  - Priority: P0
  - Estimated: 4 hours
  - Dependencies: HYD-017 groundwork (done)
  - Context Needed: codex resume integration plan, resume alert thresholds

### ðŸŸ¡ HIGH PRIORITY (Core features)
- [ ] HYD-020: Expand status & diagnostics endpoints
  - Priority: P1
  - Dependencies: HYD-019
  - Acceptance Criteria: Status surfaces resume success/failure metrics

### ðŸŸ¢ STANDARD PRIORITY
- [ ] HYD-021: Extend CLI for task filtering/resume triggers
- [ ] HYD-022: Document multi-agent workflow in README/docs

### ðŸ”µ BACKLOG (Nice to have)
- [ ] HYD-023: Visualize task graph via web dashboard
- [ ] HYD-024: Slack notifications for agent handoffs

### ðŸŽ¯ Validation Checklist (Codex Resume Flow)
- [ ] Trigger Codex resume against real session to confirm failure count reset on success
- [ ] Induce controlled resume failure to generate `resume_alert` and verify warning log emission
- [ ] Run `hydra_diag metrics`/`alerts` post-run to confirm telemetry matches status payload
- [ ] Pipe alert payload into downstream monitoring channel (stubbed notification acceptable)

## AGENT ACTIVATION CONTEXT

### For Next Agent Activation
**ACTIVATE**: CODER_IMPLEMENTATION (after Conport Manager compiles persistence context)
**REASON**: Need implementation of resumable task state ingestion prior to reviewer pass.

### Critical Context for Resumption
1. **Architecture Decisions**
   - MCP server uses FastMCP tool decorators; modular components registered at bootstrap.
   - ChromaDB is authoritative store for events, tasks, and context packages.
   - Task orchestration currently in-memory; persistence upgrade underway.

2. **Technical Constraints**
   - Preserve backward compatibility with existing tool schemas.
   - Status resource must respond in <150ms to avoid host timeouts.
   - Avoid blocking operations in MCP tool handlers (async required).

3. **Known Issues/Gotchas**
   - Task state lost on restart (current priority fix).
   - Worktree paths currently provided via context; enforce validation.
   - FastMCP dependency not available in test environment; rely on stubs.

4. **Testing Requirements**
   - Maintain `PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/pytest` green.
   - Add regression tests for task state replay.
   - Validate JSON serialization of status output.

5. **External Dependencies**
   - chromadb (embedded) for persistence.
   - Codex CLI (path configurable) for agent spawning.
   - (Future) Conport API for context storage.

### Environment Setup Requirements
```bash
node: 18.17.0
python: 3.11
postgresql: 15
redis: 7.0

# Environment variables
CODEX_PATH=
CODEX_DEFAULT_MODEL=
CHROMA_PERSIST_PATH=./storage/chroma
HYDRA_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### Recent Decisions & Rationale
- Store task/session/worktree events in Chroma to support replayable orchestration.
- Surface status previews instead of full timelines for lightweight monitoring.
- Retain in-memory task map for fast access; plan to hydrate from Chroma on startup.

### Valid Transitions:
- PLANNING â†’ IMPLEMENTING
- IMPLEMENTING â†’ REVIEWING
- REVIEWING â†’ IMPLEMENTING (if rejected)
- REVIEWING â†’ DEPLOYED (if approved)
- DEPLOYED â†’ PLANNING (next iteration)

### State History (Last 5)

2. IMPLEMENTING (HYD-007)
3. IMPLEMENTING (HYD-006)
4. IMPLEMENTING (HYD-005)
5. IMPLEMENTING (HYD-004)

### Metrics

## ORCHESTRATION OPTIMIZATION RULES

### Parallel Execution Triggers
- When updating RESUMEWORK.md, concurrently update Conport, analyze parallelizable tasks (HYD-010/HYD-012), prep next agent context, archive task artifacts.

### Context Preservation Strategy
- Persist error/debug patterns, performance benchmarks (Chroma event templates), security guidelines (tool descriptions), architecture rationale (docs/multiagent_workflow.md), and validated testing strategies.

### Handoff Optimization
- Each handoff must specify next action, context references (Chroma session timestamps), success criteria (task acceptance), blockers (dependency graph), and rollback (replay event stream).

### Continuous Improvement
- After each task completion: log actuals to Chroma, document new patterns, append to error knowledge base, refine agent prompts in `profiles/` as needed.

## Usage Instructions

1. Load this orchestration prompt when modifying RESUMEWORK.md.
2. Execute sections in parallel, cross-reference Conport packages, validate state transitions, and prepare next agent activation instructions.
3. To resume work, start with *Project Status Snapshot*, load appropriate agent profile, fetch context package (CPK-2025-009), assess parallel opportunities, proceed with implementation.

### Critical Success Metrics
- Zero context gaps between handoffs
- 100% decision traceability via Chroma + RESUMEWORK.md
- Parallel execution whenever dependency graph allows
- Growing knowledge base in Conport (CTX-* packages)
- Decreasing review cycles once reviewer agent activates

**Single Source of Truth**: RESUMEWORK.md captures the live brain of Hydra MCP. Keep it synchronized with Conport to enable any agent to resume seamlessly.
